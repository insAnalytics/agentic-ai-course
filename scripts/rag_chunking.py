"""
Module 5's chunkers, shared by the offline scripts and identical to the course's code.

These functions are copied unchanged from Module 5 Lesson 3 (fixed-size and
structure-aware splitting), so the chunk text embedded offline is exactly the
text the browser produces when a lesson chunks the corpus. Vectors are looked up
by a hash of that text, so any difference, even one character, would break the
lookup: if the lessons' chunker changes, change this file to match and
regenerate the embeddings.

count_tokens here is the course's estimate for strings (about four characters
per token), the same as fakeClient's COUNT_TOKENS for text.
